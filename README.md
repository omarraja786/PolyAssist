This android application is being developed to assist those who are impaired using different accessibility features which will include `Text to Speech`, `Speech to Text`, `Colour Blind Mode` and a `Optical Character Recognition` function.
These are the primary features that have been defined in the documentation however if progress goes ahead of what had been planned then additional features can be added.



<h2> Text to Speech ðŸ”Š </h2>

The text to speech feature will convert any text to be read out aloud. The aim is to support the main usages such as reading out text messages, reading out browser pages or files such as a pdf of doc file.

<h2> Speech to Text ðŸ’¬ </h2>

Speech to Text is built in to the app that will allow the user to tap on an icon that will ask for speech input. These commands are limited to those implemented so as this is a work in progress, more commands will be added.
Some examples could be to make a phone call, send a text message, ask for the time/date, set an alarm and so on. The possibilities are endless so these commands will be implemented in a sense of giving priority to more commonly used phrases.

<h2> Colour Blind Mode ðŸŽ¨ </h2>

The colour blind mode will also be an optional toggle for users. The aim of this feature is to either converting the whole display of the phone to transform colours depending on the type of colour vision issue the user has or using the camera to take a picture and then converting the image to the correct colours they eye can see.

<h2> Optical Character Recognition ðŸ“± </h2>

The idea of this feature is to process and detect text in images and videos and then to read it out loud. Again, depending on the time constraints and available APIâ€™s there could be possible implantation for identifying different languages.

<h2> Background Running </h2>
What does it mean to be background running? Essentially when this app is installed on your device and is booted up; the application will run automatically. This app will continuously run in the background so if a user wanted to activate a feature i.e. the Speech to Text they can shake their phone from anywhere and it will activate this feature.
The user will have the option to decide whether or not they want the app to load on bootup but the app being background running will remain.

<h2> Additional Features </h2>
Dependent on the progress of the application there are a few further ideas to be implemented in to the application.
<br />
<br />

**- [- Blue Light Filter - Protect the users eyes by reducing blue light emissions which will produce less strain on the eyes -]**

**- {- Additional functionality for Text to Speech i.e. Be able to read out a wider range of sources -}**

**- [- Additional commands for speech to text (More specific) -]**


<h2> Instructions on Usage </h2>
Once the app is installed, it is ready to be used. If you restart your phone the app will open on bootup bringing up the home screen menu.
Each feature will have its own button which will take the user to the features respective page.

For example let's say the user wants to make a phone call they will first click on the Speech to Text icon, then tap the microphone icon in the middle of the screen.
The user will then speak the command: "Make a phone call". Wait for the next beep noise and dialogue box to pop up and then speak the phone number. This will then accept the input
and make the call.
When the call has ended the user is taken back to the page with the mic icon to speak the next command.

> Can I access certain pages without physically touching the device?

Yes, currently the only method is to shake the device to access the speech to text page. This will be further improved such that a different amount of shakes will be registered
to a different page i.e. 1 shake for TTS, 2 shakes for STT and so on.
