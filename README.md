The primary aim was to create an easy to use, multi-function accessibility application for android users. With the lack of accessibility being integrated into daily use applications, something needed to be made for this side of the market. 


<h2> Text to Speech ðŸ”Š </h2>

The text to speech feature will convert any text to be read out aloud. The aim is to support the main usages such as reading out text messages, reading out browser pages or files such as a pdf of doc file.

<h2> Speech to Text ðŸ’¬ </h2>

Speech to Text is built in to the app that will allow the user to tap on an icon that will ask for speech input. These commands are limited to those implemented so as this is a work in progress, more commands will be added.
Some examples could be to make a phone call, send a text message, ask for the time/date, set an alarm and so on. The possibilities are endless so these commands will be implemented in a sense of giving priority to more commonly used phrases.

<h2> Optical Character Recognition ðŸ“± </h2>

The idea of this feature is to process and detect text in images and videos and then to read it out loud. 

<h2> Floating Action Button </h2>

Essentially a small button that overlays the screen that can be tapped to access different accessibility features such as increasing the volume, scrolling, powering off the phone which is useful for users that struggle with using the physical buttons 

<h2> Background Running </h2>
What does it mean to be background running? Essentially when this app is installed on your device and is booted up; the application will run automatically. This app will continuously run in the background so if a user wanted to activate a feature i.e. the Speech to Text they can shake their phone from anywhere and it will activate this feature.
The user will have the option to decide whether or not they want the app to load on bootup but the app being background running will remain.

<h2> Additional Features </h2>
A few settings that may assist the user such as starting the application on device bootup, shaking the phone to navigate around the app.


<h2> Instructions on Usage </h2>
Once the app is installed, it is ready to be used. If you restart your phone the app will open on bootup bringing up the home screen menu.
Each feature will have its own button which will take the user to the features respective page.

For example let's say the user wants to make a phone call they will first click on the Speech to Text icon, then tap the microphone icon in the middle of the screen.
The user will then speak the command: "Make a phone call". Wait for the next beep noise and dialogue box to pop up and then speak the phone number. This will then accept the input
and make the call.
When the call has ended the user is taken back to the page with the mic icon to speak the next command.

> Can I access certain pages without physically touching the device?

Yes, currently the only method is to shake the device to access the different pages. The different amount of shakes will be registered
to a different page i.e. 1 shake for TTS, 2 shakes for STT and so on.
